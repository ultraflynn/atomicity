Atomicity specialise in providing high quality technical solutions to complex business problems. Services range from on-site technical expertise through to the development, delivery and support of custom-built domain specific applications.

Technology never stands still and at Atomicity we pride ourselves on keeping up to date with the latest innovations and in developing the skills to know when to apply them. It's occasionally said that when you're holding a hammer every problem looks nail. The one-size-fits-all mentality just doesn't work and it's vital to choose the appropriate technologies to solve a particular problem. Having a comprehensive toolbox of tools, concepts and working practices is critical to being able to deliver the right solution.

It's not just about technology though, our developers focus on getting things done within a team environment. There are a myriad of different concepts and practices, like Agile and Scrum which focus on team dynamics through to GTD and Pomodoro which allow individuals to be effective.
